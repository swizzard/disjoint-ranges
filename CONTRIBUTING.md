Pull requests are more than welcome! I am Not Clever, and there are assuredly improvements to make.
Please be aware of the following:
* Pull requests that add functionality unaccompanied by tests and documentation will be rejected.
* Pull requests that fail to sufficiently explain and justify the changes they introduce will be rejected.
* Use of Large Language Models and similar technology must be declared, and slop will be rejected.
